##Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted the redundant part 'An R Implementation of the' in the description field.
* Combined the first two sentences in the description field In the way you suggested.
* Omitted '(under GPL-2)' in the description field.
* Added a reference to Randall O'Reilly's algorithm in the description field. There is no doi or arXiv, because it was a PhD thesis. But I provide the URL. Reading your comment, for me it was unclear, whether this information should be in the text (which I aimed for), or as a reference after the text.
* Put 'MATLAB' in single quotes in the DESCRIPTION, LICENSE, as well as in the documentation of all classes.

## Test environments
* local arch linux, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel 2017-09-12 r73242 and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE on the win-builder, because this is the first submission:
  
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Johannes Titz <johannes.titz@gmail.com>'

New submission

Title: An R implementation of the artificial neural networks algorithm Leabra
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Johannes Titz
Maintainer: Johannes Titz <johannes.titz@gmail.com>
Description: This package is an R implementation of Leabra (local error driven
    and associative biologically realistic algorithm). You can construct
    artificial neural networks that are biologically realistic and balance
    supervised and unsupervised learning within a single framework. It is based
    on the Matlab version by Sergio Verduzco-Flores (under GPL-2), which in turn
    was based on the description of the algorithm by Randall O'Reilly. For more
    general (not R specific) information on the algorithm Leabra see

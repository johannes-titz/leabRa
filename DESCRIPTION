Title: Implementation of the artifical neural networks algorithm Leabra
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Johannes Titz
Maintainer: Johannes Titz <johannes.titz@gmail.com>
Description: This is a port of Leabra (local error driven and associative 
    biologically realistic algorithm) for R. You can construct
    artifical neural networks that are biologically realistic and can let them 
    learn supervised or unsupervised within one single framework. For more 
    general (not R specific) information on the algorithm Leabra see 
    https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Leabra.

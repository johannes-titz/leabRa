Title: The Artificial Neural Networks Algorithm Leabra
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Johannes Titz
Maintainer: Johannes Titz <johannes.titz@gmail.com>
Description: The algorithm Leabra (local error driven and associative
    biologically realistic algorithm) allows for the construction of artificial
    neural networks that are biologically realistic and balance supervised and
    unsupervised learning within a single framework. This package is based on
    the 'MATLAB' version by Sergio Verduzco-Flores, which in turn was based on
    the description of the algorithm by Randall O'Reilly (1996)
    URL:<ftp://grey.colorado.edu/pub/oreilly/thesis/oreilly_thesis.all.pdf>. For
    more general (not 'R' specific) information on the algorithm Leabra see
